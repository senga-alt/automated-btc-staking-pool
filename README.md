# Bitcoin Staking Pool Smart Contract

A Clarity smart contract implementation of a Bitcoin staking pool with yield optimization, risk assessment, and optional insurance coverage. This contract implements the SIP-010 fungible token standard and provides comprehensive staking functionality with automated yield distribution.

## Features

- **SIP-010 Compliant**: Implements the standard fungible token interface
- **Yield Optimization**: Dynamic yield calculation based on stake amount and time
- **Risk Assessment**: Built-in risk scoring system for stakers
- **Insurance Coverage**: Optional insurance mechanism for stake protection
- **Automated Distribution**: Scheduled yield distribution with historical tracking
- **Flexible Staking**: Support for staking and unstaking with minimum amount requirements

## Technical Specifications

- **Token Details**
  - Name: Staked BTC (stBTC)
  - Decimals: 8
  - Minimum Stake: 0.01 BTC (1,000,000 sats)
  - Base APY: 5%

## Core Functions

### Staking Operations

```clarity
(define-public (stake (amount uint)))
(define-public (unstake (amount uint)))
(define-public (claim-rewards))
```

### Yield Management

```clarity
(define-public (distribute-yield))
(define-private (calculate-yield (amount uint) (blocks uint)))
```

### Administrative Functions

```clarity
(define-public (initialize-pool (initial-rate uint)))
(define-public (set-token-uri (new-uri (optional (string-utf8 256))))
```

### Query Functions

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-pool-stats))
(define-read-only (get-staker-balance (staker principal)))
(define-read-only (get-staker-rewards (staker principal)))
(define-read-only (get-risk-score (staker principal)))
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description                |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| u100 | Owner-only operation       |
| u101 | Pool already initialized   |
| u102 | Pool not initialized       |
| u103 | Pool is active             |
| u104 | Pool is inactive           |
| u105 | Invalid amount             |
| u106 | Insufficient balance       |
| u107 | No yield available         |
| u108 | Below minimum stake amount |
| u109 | Unauthorized operation     |

## Security Features

1. **Access Control**

   - Owner-only administrative functions
   - Protected stake management
   - Authorized transfer validation

2. **Risk Management**

   - Dynamic risk scoring system
   - Stake size-based risk assessment
   - Optional insurance coverage

3. **Yield Protection**
   - Minimum stake requirements
   - Time-locked distributions
   - Balance verification

## Implementation Details

### Yield Calculation

The yield is calculated using the formula:

```
yield = (amount * rate * time_factor) / 10000
```

where:

- `time_factor` is based on daily blocks (144 blocks)
- `rate` is the current yield rate
- Base APY starts at 5% (500 basis points)

### Risk Scoring

Risk scores are calculated based on:

- Stake size
- Historical participation
- Accumulated rewards

## Usage

1. **Contract Deployment**

   - Deploy the contract
   - Initialize the pool with `initialize-pool`
   - Set token URI if needed

2. **Staking**

   - Users must stake minimum 0.01 BTC
   - Rewards accumulate based on stake size and time
   - Claims can be made after distribution periods

3. **Administration**
   - Regular yield distribution required
   - Monitor risk scores
   - Manage insurance fund if active

## Limitations

- Fixed distribution periods (144 blocks)
- Minimum stake requirement
- Owner-dependent yield distribution
- Single token support (BTC only)

## Future Improvements

- Multi-token support
- Automated yield distribution
- Dynamic minimum stake adjustment
- Enhanced risk scoring algorithm
- Decentralized governance
- Advanced insurance mechanisms
